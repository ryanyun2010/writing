	<h2>When I Got Arden</h2>
	<p>We were on the car to the airport to pick up our new dog. I was so excited to get my new dog. My heart was racing like a cheetah running. When we got to the airport we saw Arden. He was so cute and he had a wide smile on his face. His fur was white with some brown spots. He had a big cage. His harness was blue. He was very scared and would not let us touch or pet him. In his cage there was another dog. The other dog's fur was black. There were also some other cages. On Arden's cage there was a label that said Arden. Under his name it said some of his information.
